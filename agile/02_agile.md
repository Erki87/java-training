# Agile software development

---

## What is software engineering?

- Building software
- One shot implementation is impossible
- Cost of change
    - Exponential development effort (product complexity)
    - Logarithmic developer productivity (product complexity)

---

## What is software engineering?

- Professionalism (in quality, in time, in budget)
- Phases
    - Plan
    - Design
    - Build
    - Test
    - Review
    - Deploy

---

## Tools

- Programming language
- IDE
- Debugger
- VCS
- Static code analysis

---

## Software development processes

- Sequential
    - Waterfall
    - V-Model
- Agile (incremental)
    - Scrum
    - Extreme Programming (XP)

## Choosing the right software development processes

- Important
- Criteria
    - Requirements complete
    - Risk (domain, technologies, ...)
    - Schedule (time, ressources, ...)
    - Interaction with customer/management

---

## Why agile (1/2)

- Why sequential models were used in the past
    - Upfront planning to detect errors early
    - Models/documents are cheaper than code

---

## Why agile (2/2)

- Why agile models are used today
    - Code got cheaper to produce
    - Cheap and faster hardware
    - Compile & excution time
    - High level programming languages
    - Test automation
    - Code generation
    - Static code analysis
    - Upfront work is liability
    - Plans change over time

# Agile paper planes

---

## Goals & Rules

- Build as many flyable paper planes as you can
- Planes must fly a specified distance 
- One player can only do one fold at a time
- One player
    - Counts planes (#Ok, #Nok, #WIP, #Estimated)
    - Stopps time
- Final score = #Tested - #WIP

---

## Iteration

- 3 minutes planning + Estimate the planes built
- 3 minutes build & test
- 3 minutes review

---

## Review

- What made you improve over the iterations?
- How would a waterfall plane building process look like?

---

# Scrum basics

## Backlog item (user story)

- Description
    - As a {role}
    - I can {capability}
    - so that {receive benefit}
- Priority
- Estimate in story points
